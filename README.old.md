# WorkoutClock
Timer for Working Out

Sometimes it's hard to find a way to show a coach what he or she means to you. I'm sure many like me have gone without showing our appreciation the way we would like to be able to because we don't know what to do. I still don't know what to do, but when I decided to build a workout timer to use for boxing sessions, I thought of a way I could honor my coach, Javier Torres.

It's a simple workout clock.

As a user, I want to launch an application to assist with timed workouts. 

When I open the app, then I get the choice of immediate workout, sign in for extra features, or create and account if I am new.

When I select to workout, then I am prompted to put in an active time in minutes or seconds, and a rest time in minutes or seconds, and/or a total workout duration.
